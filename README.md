# NYC RatMap
This application pulls data from the open data source (data.cityofnewyork.us)[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/], an API that provides a wealth of information about city activities.  This application pulls 311 calls of rodent sightings (a dataset that goes back to October 2011) and totals them by borough and by date, in addition they are plotted on a map using the (mapbox API)[https://www.mapbox.com/].  The app takes a start and end date and then returns the results, which are then filterable by borough.  

This was inspired by recent news stories about the effects of the COVID-19 shutdowns causing rats that live on restaurant waste to struggle for food.
