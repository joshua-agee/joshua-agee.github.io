### Projects from Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly

* [RatMap](https://github.com/joshua-agee/joshua-agee.github.io/tree/master/ratMap)
    This project demonstrates the use of a couple different APIs - open data from the city of New York 311 calls and the mapbox API for displaying the results.

* [MovieCollection (code)](https://github.com/joshua-agee/MovieCollection)
    This project enables users to make collections of movies using data from IMDB-API. 

* [CarrieOKey (production)](https://carrieokey.herokuapp.com/) -- [CarrieOKey Front-End (code)](https://github.com/joshua-agee/CarrieOKey) -- [CarrieOKey Back-End (code)](https://github.com/joshua-agee/CarrieOKeyAPI) 
    CarrieOKey was a group project to allow users to enter songs and lyrics into a collection and ultimately join a video conference with other users to have a virtual karaoke experience. It was built with React for the front end, and Node/MongoDB on the backend.

* [BreadBakingBuddy (Production)](https://breadbakingbuddy.herokuapp.com) -- [BreadBakingBuddy Front-End (code)](https://github.com/joshua-agee/BreadBakingBuddy) -- [BreadBakingBuddy Back-End (code)](https://github.com/joshua-agee/BBB-API) 
    My final project allows users to add and share bread making recipes with eachother.  It was built with a React front-end and a Flask/Postgres backend.
